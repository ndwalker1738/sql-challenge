  My first project as  a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard is to learn about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. Data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis were used to complete this project using PgAdmin 4.
  
 - 1.) Sketched ERD Diagram using quickdatabasediagrams.com
 - 2.) Created tables by importing all 6 CSV files 
 - 3.) Analyzed the data :
 - List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
 - List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
 - List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last      name, and first name.
 - List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name,    and department name.
-  List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins        with the letter B.
-  List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.  
-  List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first       name, and department name.
-  List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
